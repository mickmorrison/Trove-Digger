This script is the start of what I hope will become a functional app for querying the Trove API and returning sources in a useful format. Key features need to be:
* Ability to write custom queries based on the trove API technical guide. Initially queries will need to be manually written, but there may be ways to automate this
* Ability to return hundreds or more records in a single query
* Ability to parse returned information into a data.frame and csv file
* Ability to download linked PDFs
* Ability to download useful bibliographic information (e.g. a file to import to Zotero)

The code at present is very basic and not at all working well, but it is a start. Other contributors welcome.

Mick Morrison
